# Multi-Dimensional-Data-Analytics-Road-Accident-in-India-Project

**Introduction**
This project aims to perform multi-dimensional data analytics on road accident data in India. The goal is to extract valuable insights and patterns that can help in understanding the causes and consequences of road accidents, ultimately aiding in developing strategies for reducing accidents and improving road safety.

**Objectives**
To analyze road accident data across various dimensions such as time, location, vehicle type, and demographics.
To identify key factors contributing to road accidents in India.
To visualize the data in an informative and interactive manner.
To provide actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders to enhance road safety.
